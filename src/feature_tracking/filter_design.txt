What is this file?

This file id the design file of the Kalman filter that is supposed to filter 
the (static) features detected in the arena, in order to localize the drone.

Design :

T_T c dur de faire un filtre de kalman

At the moment :

let r be the tri-dimentional coorinates of position, and of components
r_x (depth position)
r_y (horizontal position)
r_z (vertical position)

let v be the first-order derivative of r (therfore, v is the speed), a vector of three components,
v = [v_x, v_y, v_z] ^T

let a be the second-order derivative of r (the acceleration), a vector of three components,
a = [a_x, a_y, a_z] ^T

let x be the state of out kalman filter model.
x = [r_x, v_x, r_y, v_y, r_z, v_z] ^T

let x+ be the next state of our system
let F be the state transition matrix. 

x+ = Fx

for 
F = [ 1,dt, 0, 0, 0, 0 ]
    [ 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0 ]
    [ 0, 0, 1,dt, 0, 0 ]
    [ 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0 ]
    [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 1,dt ]
    [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1 ]

H = [ 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ]
    [ 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0 ]
    [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0 ]
